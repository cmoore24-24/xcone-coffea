Use <source start.sh> to begin coffea environment (need to already have conda environment for coffea already made. See topcoffea readme for instructions on coffea installation/conda instructions). Will need to edit start.sh with your own environment name.

Use <source xcone-run.sh> to run a coffea analysis. Produces desired plots in the "plots" directory. Most plot changes need to be made directly in processor/simple_plot.py in order to change what histogram is produced/what it will be named.
